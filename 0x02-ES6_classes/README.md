name (String)
length (Number)
students (array of Strings)
Make sure to verify the type of attributes during object creation
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.

3. Methods, static methods, computed methods names..... MONEY
mandatory
Implement a class named Currency:

- Constructor attributes:
code (String)
name (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
Implement a method named displayFullCurrency that will return the attributes in the following format name (code).

4. Pricing
mandatory
Import the class Currency from 3-currency.js

Implement a class named Pricing:

If a class that extends from it does not have a evacuationWarningMessage method, throw an error with the message Class extending Building must override evacuationWarningMessage


6. Inheritance
mandatory
Import Building from 5-building.js.

Implement a class named SkyHighBuilding that extends from Building:

Constructor attributes:
sqft (Number) (must be assigned to the parent class Building)
floors (Number)

9. Hoisting
mandatory
Fix this code and make it work.

const class2019 = new HolbertonClass(2019, 'San Francisco');
const class2020 = new HolbertonClass(2020, 'San Francisco');

export class HolbertonClass {
  constructor(year, location) {
    this._year = year;
    this._location = location;
  }

  get year() {
    return this._year;
  }

  get location() {
    return this._location;
  }
}

const student1 = new StudentHolberton('Guillaume', 'Salva', class2020);
const student2 = new StudentHolberton('John', 'Doe', class2020);
const student3 = new StudentHolberton('Albert', 'Clinton', class2019);
const student4 = new StudentHolberton('Donald', 'Bush', class2019);
const student5 = new StudentHolberton('Jason', 'Sandler', class2019);

export class StudentHolberton {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this._firstName = firstName;
    this._lastName = lastName;
    this._holbertonClass = holbertonClass;
  }

  get fullName() {
    return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
  }

  get holbertonClass() {
    return this.holbertonClass;
  }

  get fullStudentDescription() {
    return `${self._firstName} ${self._lastName} - ${self._holbertonClass.year} - ${self._holbertonClass.location}`;
  }
}


export const listOfStudents = [student1, student2, student3, student4, student5];
Result:

bob@dylan:~$ cat 9-main.js
import listOfStudents from "./9-hoisting.js";

console.log(listOfStudents);

const listPrinted = listOfStudents.map(
    student => student.fullStudentDescription
);

console.log(listPrinted)
